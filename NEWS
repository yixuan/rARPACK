      CHANGES IN rARPACK VERSION 0.7-0

NEW FEATURES

    o Support for implicit matrix, contributed by Jiali Mei.
    User can supply a function FUN rather than an explicit matrix
    to eigs(), and the eigenvalues of this operator will be computed.
    FUN(x, args) must return a vector of the same length as x.

BUG FIXES

    o Avoid using a C random number generator.
    o Fix a bug possibly coming from ARPACK, which sometimes give
    incorrect result of complex eigenvectors.





      CHANGES IN rARPACK VERSION 0.6-0

NEW FEATURES

    o Add support for new matrix types: dgeMatrix and dgRMatrix.
    o eigs() now allows a full Eigen Decomposition, meaning that
    all the eigenvalues are calculated. In this case eigs() is
    simply a wrapper of eigen(), and with a warning issued.
    o Ditto for svds()

BUG FIXES

    o Rewrite C++ code using classes and templates.
    o Fix errors in checking the values of k and ncv.





      CHANGES IN rARPACK VERSION 0.5-0

NEW FEATURES

    o Add svds() function to calculate truncated SVD.

BUG FIXES

    o Now sort eigenvalues in decreasing order.
    o Rename eigs.sym() to eigs_sym() to avoid confusion.
    o Fix a matrix out-of-bound error.





      CHANGES IN rARPACK VERSION 0.4-0

NEW FEATURES

    o Implement shift-and-invert mode for all supported eigen problems.

BUG FIXES

    o Update arpack-ng to 3.1.4





      CHANGES IN rARPACK VERSION 0.3-0

NEW FEATURES

    o Now eigs() supports real symmetric matrices.





      CHANGES IN rARPACK VERSION 0.2-0

NEW FEATURES

    o Now eigs() supports sparse real nonsymmetric matrices of the class "dgCMatrix",
      defined in the Matrix package.





      CHANGES IN rARPACK VERSION 0.1-0

NEW FEATURES

    o Initial version. For now eigs() supports dense real nonsymmetric matrices.
